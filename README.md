A collection of type-safe utility functions in TypeScript for working with
objects, lists, tuples, â€¦

I have run into the same issues so many times over the past decade that I've
finally decided to compile my solutions for common problems. No guarantees how
often I will actually update this repo but I hope to add stuff whenever I run
into a new (common) problem that's not covered yet.

Also, there is no NPM package for now, since I think it makes more sense for you
to just copy & paste (and adapt) the code you need.
